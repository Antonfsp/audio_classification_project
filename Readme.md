This is a personal project with self-learning purposes. The goal is to be able
to create a (deep-learning) model capable of identify if, given an audio file
with a single instrument playing, it is a clarinet or not. 

The dataset used is the one created by:

Lostanlen, Vincent, Cella, Carmine-Emanuele, Bittner, Rachel, & Essid, Slim. (2019). Medley-solos-DB: a cross-collection dataset for musical instrument recognition (1.2) [Data set]. International Society of Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR), New York, NY, USA. Zeno
